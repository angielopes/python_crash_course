"""Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three names of cats
in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file.
Write a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the
file to the screen. Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the
FileNotFound error, and print a friendly message if a file is missing.
Move one of the files to a different location on your system, and make sure
the code in the except block executes properly."""
